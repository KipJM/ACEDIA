This repository contains the entirety of the Godot Project of [ACEDIA](https://kip.gay/acedia).  
ACEDIA is a short game for those who are queer.  
For the game binaries, please see the itch.io page: [Link](https://kip.gay/acedia)  
For the original soundtrack, please see https://kip.gay/acedia/soundtrack .

## Planar Reflection
This game features a custom planar reflection system, I plan to repackage this system in ACEDIA into a standalone open-source Godot plugin in the future.

## Editing
This project is built using Godot 4.4.1 mono. **YOU NEED THE MONO VERSION, THIS PROJECT USES BOTH GDScript AND C#.**  
You should be able to run the project immediately. All scenes are categorized into their own directory, Universal/ contains assets and code that is designed to be referenced by multiple scenes.
Testing/ scenes may not all work because of underlying code changes, but it still should give a pretty good idea on how each component of this project works.
